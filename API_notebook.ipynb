    "# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING (PREDICTING SEPSIS WITH FastAPI)\n",
    "### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Sepsis is a medical condition caused by the body's response to infection. This life-threatening condition can lead to tissue damage, organ failure or dysfunction and death if not attended to on time. The challenge lies in identifying sepsis early in its course when interventions can be most effective. Hence, early detection and prompt intervention are critical to improving patient outcome and reduction of mortality rates.\n",
    "In this project, a predictive model for sepsis detection will be developed. The model will utilize features like Plasma glucoselevel, Blood Work Result-1, Blood Pressure, Blood Work Result-2, Blood Work Result-3, Body mass index, Blood Work Result-4, Patient's age and the presence of insurance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### GOAL\n",
    "The aim of this project is to develop a FastAPI application which will be used for predicting sepsis in patients. This app will employ machine learning models trained on clinical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STAKEHOLDERS\n",
    "Stakeholders for this FastAPI app includes;\n",
    "•\tPhysicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals working in hospitals, emergency departments, and intensive care units.\n",
    "•\tHealthcare administrators and policymakers involved in quality improvement initiatives and resource allocation.\n",
    "•\tResearchers and clinicians interested in sepsis management and predictive analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATA SOURCE & DESCRIPTION\n",
    "This dataset is a modified version of a publicly available data source obtained from John Hopkins University.\n",

    "### HYPOTHESIS:\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis (H0):**\n",
    "*There is no significant difference in Blood_Pressure and BMI between patients with and without sepsis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**\n",
    "*There is a significant difference in Blood_Pressure and BMI between patients with and without sepsis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS:\n",
    "1. *Investigate the distribution of plasma glucose levels among patients with and without Sepsis*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Compare the distribution of Blood Work Results for patients with and without Sepsis*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Examine the relationship between blood pressure values and the occurance of Sepsis*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Analyze the distribution of Body Mass Index among individuals with and without Sepsis*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *Explore the age distribution of patients with Sepsis compared to those without*\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Determine the percentage of patients with valid insurance among those with and without Sepsis*\n",
    "\n",
    "7. *Assess how well combined factors predict Sepsis occurrence*\n",
    "\n",
    "8. *Evaluate the accuracy of the predictive model in ideentifying Sepsis based on selected features*\n"
